# Ulises Estecche

Hi! This is me and welcome to my GitHub repository. I work on different initiatives and many of them are here. If you want to add a comment or help me with a project, just let me know.

## Java

The Java platform is the one I preferred the most, but currently I am doing some Python and Ionic + Angular.

## Do I like programming?

I started a while ago with this, and yes, I love this world of 0s and 1s. I am very lucky because I have participated in very interesting projects with a lot of requirements, analysis, and then of course the coding part.
Across all these years I have learned Unix, C, and from there, trying to be the best, one line of code at a time.
